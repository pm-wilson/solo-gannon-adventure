          You have been defeated yet again by that infernal hero and his magic
          sword. Peace reigns in the land once again. The snobby princess has
          claimed her kingdom and the pesants are living out there lives NOT
          bound by your will, but by their own thoughts and feelings.
        </p>

          Lucky for you, they never finish the job entirely and due to
          meticulous planning your spirit has endured yet again to rise up
          through the masses and take over the world. You simply need to get
          your hands on the <span id="quest-count">00</span> magic items and the
          world can be yours once again.
